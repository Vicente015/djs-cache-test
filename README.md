# djs-cache-test

This is a test to compare the data received on events between discord.js-light v4 and discord.js v13 with the new option to limit caches.
All tests have been done with all intents and partials enabled.
You can see the code used in `index.js`.

**Disabling the guild cache in discord.js results in the majority of events not being emitted or errors occurring, so this does not take that into account.**
